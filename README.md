 ## Lessor Data
 
## How to Install and Run the Project

This project utilizes python and requires no additional installation. 

## How to Use the Project

The project will display a series of graphs and plots broken down to state and territory (where applicable) level as well as an overview based on region. Plots also include a linear regression annotation to give a visual representation and provide a guideline on where lease contracts are expected to manifest.

## Product Description:

Lessor Data is a comparative collection based on government asset data. It is intended to be used to identify the current state of leases, showcasing anomalous contracts to provide data 
to be reviewed in future negotiations.

  Questions.

1. Within the United States, where is the highest population of government leased properties?
2. What are the correlations, if any, between rent amount and usable ft^2 in the lease? 
3. What are the correlations, if any, between usable and rentable ft^2 in the lease?
4. What are the correlations, if any, between rent amount and parking spaces(pick one)?
5. What is the distribution of parking space sizes?
6. What are the correlations, if any, between ZIP code and length of lease?
7. Bar Chart and Length of lease pd.cut pie chart?
8. What are the correlations, if any, between rent amount and ft^2 of unit leased?
9. What are the correlations, if any, between ZIP code and rent of unit leased?

## How to Contribute to the Project

If you would like to contribute further to the project, the continuation of data collection over time, dissection of data into finer geographical markers and funding are welcome.

Any suggestions for additional use cases are appreciated as well.
